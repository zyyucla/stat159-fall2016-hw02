<h4 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>
<p>Linear regression is an important approach in modeling. In this report we reproduce the main results presented in section 3.1 <em>Simple Linear Regression</em> of the book <strong>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</strong></p>
<h4 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>The overall goal is to provide advice on how to improve sales of the particular product. More specifically, the idea is to determine whether there is an association between advertising and sales, and if so, develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.</p>
<h4 id="data"><strong>Data</strong></h4>
<p>The Advertising data set consists of the <strong>Sales</strong> (in thousands of units) of a particular product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for the product in each of those markets for three different media: <strong>TV,</strong> <strong>Radio</strong>, and <strong>Newspaper</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="methodology"><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<p>We consider one media from the data set, <strong>TV</strong>, and study its relationship with <strong>Sales</strong>. For this purpose, we use a simple linear model: Sales= <span class="math"><em>β</em></span><em>0+ <span class="math"><em>β</em></span></em>1*TV To estimate the coefficients <span class="math"><em>β</em></span><em>0 and <span class="math"><em>β</em></span></em>1 we fit a regression model via the least squares criterion</p>
<h4 id="results"><strong>Results</strong></h4>
<p>We compute the regression coefficients. The regression coefficients is summarized in Table 1 below: <code>{r,echo=FALSE, results=&quot;asis&quot;, comment=FALSE}    load(&quot;../data/regression.RData&quot;)    library(xtable)    reg_coe&lt;-summary(reg)$coefficients    reg_table&lt;-xtable(reg_coe,caption=&quot;Table 1: Information about regression coefficients&quot;,digits=2,floating=FALSE)    print(reg_table, caption.placement = &quot;top&quot;,type=&quot;html&quot;)</code> More information about the least squares model is given in the table below:</p>
The scatterplot of the fitted regression line is shown in Figure below.<br />

<h4 id="analysis"><strong>Analysis</strong></h4>
<p>Visual results from Figure 1 indicates that a linear fit captures the essence of the relationship, although it is somewhat deficient in the left of the plot. From Table 1 we know that β0 is 7.03 and β1 is 0.05, which means that an additional $1000 spent on TV advertising is associated with selling approximately 47.5 additional units of the product. Meanwhile, the <em>p-value</em>is close to 0, which means there <strong>is</strong> an association between TV ads and sales. From Table 2, R square is 0.61, which indicates that just under two-thirds of the variability in <strong>Sales</strong> is explained by a linear regression on <strong>TV</strong>. Therefore, combining with all the above analysis, we can conclude reasonably that TV advertising does have some effects on Sales of the targeted product.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>In conclusion, by taking data and using linear regression model, computing all relevant coefficients, we see a relatively linear relationship between TV ads and sales, and hence a non-trivial effects of TV advertising on product sales.</p>
